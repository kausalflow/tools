summary: "MyMind is an idea note, quote, page, and image collector with the usual tag-style support. You add material from the web via a capable browser plugin; but, the standout feature is AI help in your search/retrieval of information, even without tags. It displays your saved material in a card grid—think Pinterest, Pocket, and similar—with selectable density and size. A large search box sits at the top with instant results while you type."
