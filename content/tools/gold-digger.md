summary: "Gold Digger is a command-line tool for snowballing literature search, starting from a few initial papers. It uses the Semantic Scholar API to find citations and references, and provides a flexible filtering mechanism to narrow down the results."
features:
  - "Snowballing Literature Search: Automatically expands a literature search by tracing citations and references from an initial set of papers."
  - "Semantic Scholar API Integration: Fetches academic paper data, including citations and references."
  - "Flexible Filtering System: Allows users to narrow down results using a variety of criteria."
  - "Keyword & Field Filter: Search for keywords within specific paper fields like title or abstract."
  - "Year Filter: Filter papers by publication year using operators (e.g., greater than, equal to)."
  - "Author Filter: Filter papers based on an author's name."
  - "LLM-Powered Filter: Utilize a Large Language Model (e.g., Gemini) to filter papers based on a custom, natural language criterion."
  - "File-Based LLM Filter: Provide the LLM filtering criterion via a text file."
  - "Complex Logic (OR): Group filters using OR logic for more flexible searching."
  - "Multiple Output Formats: Save results in JSON or convert them to BibTeX format."
  - "BibTeX Conversion Utility: Convert existing JSON result files to .bib format."
  - "API Response Caching: Caches API calls to improve performance and reduce redundant requests."
  - "Configurable Batch Processing: Control batch sizes for API calls and LLM processing."
